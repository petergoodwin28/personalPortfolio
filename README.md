# personalPortfolio
My personal website showing off my interests and work.

The goal is to get a polished website up and running.

I want to dabble in some css/scss to make it look nice, as well as use visual components from codepen.io.

It will mainly feature me and my interests, and possibly some features like games, etc.

Otherwise it is informational and serves as my personal/professional portfolio and project.
